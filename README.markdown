## Overview

Barkeep is a fast, fun way to review code. Engineering organizations can use it to keep the bar high.

To see a video of Barkeep in action, visit [getbarkeep.org](http://getbarkeep.org).

Barkeep is standalone software that you host. Once it's set up, you can use it to track and code review any
number of git repos available on the internet. It's designed to be easy to run on Ubuntu.

### Getting started

If you're ready to install Barkeep, see the
[Installing Barkeep](https://github.com/ooyala/barkeep/wiki/Installing-Barkeep) wiki page for instructions and
a one-step shell script.

If you'd like to take Barkeep for a test-drive first or set up local development on your own machine you can
quickly install it on a Vagrant VM. See the [Vagrant](https://github.com/ooyala/barkeep/wiki/Vagrant) wiki
page for details.

### Docs

See **[the wiki](https://github.com/ooyala/barkeep/wiki)** for instructions on setting up Barkeep for
development, deploying it to your own server and tracking git repos with it.

[Read here](https://github.com/ooyala/barkeep/wiki/Comparing-Barkeep-to-other-code-review-tools) for a
comparison of Barkeep to other code review systems.
